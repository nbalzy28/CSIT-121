      <h2>The origins story of Magneto</h2>
      <p>Erik Lehnsherr, also known as Magneto, was born to a Jewish family in Germany in the 1920s. As a young boy, he and his family were captured and sent to Auschwitz, where they were subjected to horrific experiments. It was there that Erik discovered his mutant powers, the ability to manipulate metal. One day, while being led away from his family, he lashed out in anger and killed the two guards escorting him with his powers. From that moment on, Erik swore to use his powers to fight against the oppression of mutants and all those who would seek to harm them. He adopted the name Magneto, and founded the Brotherhood of Mutants, a group dedicated to mutant supremacy. Throughout his life, he has been both friend and foe to the X-Men, as he has fought for his own vision of a world where mutants can live free from persecution.</p>
