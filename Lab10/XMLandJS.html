    <h1>The Basics of XML and JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>What is XML?</h2>
    <p>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language and it is a markup language that is used for the storing and transporting data in a format that is both human and machine readable. XML allows users to define their own customs tags and structure data in a hierarchical way. XML is often used for data exchange between different systems, as it provides a standardized format for storing and sharing data that can be easily parsed by both humans and machines.</p>

    <h2>How is XML used?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Data storage and exchange: XML provides a standardized format for storing and exchanging data between different systems, regardless of the programming language or platform being used.</li>
      <li>Web services: XML is used extensively in web services, which allow different applications to communicate with each other over the internet. For example, SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging XML messages between web services.</li>
      <li>Configuration files: Many software applications use XML files for storing configuration data. This allows users to easily modify settings without having to edit complex code or configuration files.</li>
      <li>Document markup: XML can be used to mark up documents with structured data, such as scientific articles, legal contracts, and technical specifications. By using XML tags to define the structure of the document, it becomes easier to extract and analyze specific pieces of information.</li>
      <li>RSS feeds: Many websites use XML-based RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds to distribute content to subscribers. RSS feeds provide a standardized format for publishing articles, blog posts, and other content in a way that can be easily consumed by other applications.</li>
      <li>Data modeling: XML can be used to model complex data structures, such as database schemas, using XML Schema or Document Type Definitions (DTDs). This allows developers to define the structure and constraints of their data in a way that can be easily understood and enforced by other systems.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What does XML look like?</h2>
      <p>XML is visually very similar to HTML, with the main difference being that the user has to create their own custom tags. An example of XML can be seen below with the code representing a portion of a catalog book:</p>
      <div class="xmlCode">
      <p>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;</p>
      <p>&lt;catalog&gt;</p>
      <p>&lt;book id="bk101"&gt;</p>
      <p>&lt;author&gt;Gambardella, Matthew&lt;/author&gt;</p>
      <p>&lt;title&gt;XML Developer's Guide&lt;/title&gt;</p>

    <h2>What is Java Script?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, object-oriented programming language used primarily to create interactive front-end web applications. It is a scripting language that runs on the client-side of the web, meaning it is executed by a user's web browser rather than a web server. It is commonly used for creating dynamic and interactive webpages, implementing complex features like animations, user input validation, and document object model manipulation.</p>

    <h2>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS? </h2>
    <p>JavaScript is related to HTML and CSS as all three come togther to form great web applications. HTML is used to define the structre and content of the webpage. CSS is used to define the styling and presentation of the page including layouts, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. Then finally, JavaScript is used to add interacticity and dynamic functionality to the web page.</p>

    <h2>Common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Elements:</strong> document.getElementById(): This method returns an element object that matches the specified ID. For example, document.getElementById("myDiv") would return the element with the ID "myDiv".</li>
    <li><strong>Properties:</strong> innerHTML: This property sets or returns the HTML content inside an element. For example, document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "Hello, world!" would set the content of the element with the ID "myDiv" to "Hello, world!".</li>
    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> setTimeout(): This method calls a function after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, setTimeout(myFunction, 1000) would call the function myFunction after a 1-second delay.</li>
    <li><strong>Functions:</strong> parseInt(): This function parses a string and returns an integer. For example, parseInt("10") would return the number 10.</li>
  </ul>
